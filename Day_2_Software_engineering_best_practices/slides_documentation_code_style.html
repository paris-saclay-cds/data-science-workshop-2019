# Why is it important?

* For **users**
  * You want people to use your code

* For **developers / contributors**
  * You want people to help out
  * It makes your code better

---
class: center, middle

## For **YOU**: you will be using and developing your code in 6 months

---
class: middle

>  *"Good documentation helps people understand code. This makes the code more reusable and lowers maintenance costs [47]. As a result, code that is well documented makes it easier to transition when the graduate students and postdocs who have been writing code in a lab transition to the next career phase"*

# Many forms of documentation

* Code style: readability, comments

* Embedded documentation: docstrings

* API documentation

* Tutorial documentation (example notebook, sphinx website)

* Interactive help vs online html docs vs pdf docs

---

# Code readability

### *Code is read many more times than written!*

In many cases, that person is probably going to be you, six months from now.

# Docstrings

What does a function do? How do I use it? What are the arguments I need to provide? What are the default values?

# Consistency

Most important rule of any style = consistency

If you make particular decision about a style guide, use it consistently. Always. Forever

Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important.

# Style guides

## Other style guides

Google Python Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)

# PEP8: code layout

## Indentation

* Four spaces (no tab!)
* Most editors can be set to convert a tab that you type to four spaces in the file


---


# PEP8: code layout

## Maximum line length

* Keep it to 79 characters

  * Most editors can show you the line position

* Why? My monitor is big!

  * Open two files side by side? History?
  * Some teams choose to use a different max (e.g. 100)

---

# PEP8: code layout

```python
# Aligned with opening delimiter.
foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
                         var_three, var_four)

# More indentation included to distinguish this from the rest.
def long_function_name(
        var_one, var_two, var_three,
        var_four):
    print(var_one)

# Hanging indents should add a level.
foo = long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)
```

---

# PEP8: code layout

```python
# No extra indentation.
if (this_is_one_thing and
    that_is_another_thing):
    do_something()
```

--
count: false

```python
# Add a comment, which will provide some distinction in editors
# supporting syntax highlighting.
if (this_is_one_thing and
    that_is_another_thing):
    # Since both conditions are true, we can frobnicate.
    do_something()

# Add some extra indentation on the conditional continuation line.
if (this_is_one_thing
        and that_is_another_thing):
    do_something()
```

---

# PEP8: code layout

## Line spacing

* Two blank lines around top level functions
* Two blank lines around classes


* One blank line between functions in a class
* One blank line between logical groups in a function (sparingly)

---

# PEP8: code layout

## Line spacing

No:

```python
a_var = 1
def one_function():
    return something
def other_function():
    return something_else
result = one_function()
```

---
count:false

# PEP8: code layout

## Line spacing

Yes:

```python
a_var = 1


def one_function():
    return something


def other_function():
    return something_else


result = one_function()
```

---

# PEP8: imports

* Imports go at the top of a file after any comments
* Imports for separate libraries go on separate lines

--
count: false

No:

```python
import sys, os
```

Yes:

```python
import os
import sys
```

---

# PEP8: imports

* Imports are typically grouped:

  * standard library imports
  * related third party imports
  * local application/library specific imports

```python
import os
import sys

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

import my_module
```

---

# PEP8: imports

## Avoid wildcard imports

```python
from <module> import *
```

- avoids name collisions
- is explicit where a function comes from


---

# PEP8: imports

## Follow community conventions

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


---

# PEP8: whitespace

* No trailing spaces at end of a line
* Do not pad ( [ { with spaces, e.g.

```python
Yes: spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})
No:  spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )
```

* Do not pad before : ; ,    , e.g.

```python
Yes: if x == 4: print x, y; x, y = y, x
No:  if x == 4 : print x , y ; x , y = y , x
```

---
# PEP8: whitespace

* Always surround =, +=, -=, == , < , > , != , <> , <= , >= , in , not in , is , is not, and, or, not with a single space

No:

```python
i=i+1
submitted +=1
x = x * 2 - 1
hypot2 = x * x + y * y
```

Yes:

```python
i = i + 1
submitted += 1
x = x*2 - 1
hypot2 = x*x + y*y
```

--
count: false

But ...


---
# PEP8: whitespace

* Never surround `=` with a space as a function parameter argument

--
count: false

No :

```python
def complex(real, imag = 0.0):
   return magic(r = real, i = imag)
```

Yes:

```python
def complex(real, imag=0.0):
   return magic(r=real, i=imag)
```

---
# PEP8: naming conventions

* Choose variable names that won’t be confused

* Conventions:

  * modules/packages: short, lowercase (underscore)
  * classes: CamelCase (no underscores)
  * functions: lowercase, underscores
  * variables: lowercase, underscores
  * constants: UPPERCASE

### Numpydoc: Numpy Docstring Standard

```python
"""Very brief one-line function description.

A more extended description about the function...
...which can take multiple lines if required

Parameters
----------
inputname1 : type of inputname1
    description of the first input
...

Returns
-------
out1 : dtype of output
    description of the first output
...

Notes
-----
Some information about your function,...

Show in notebook, and online! (numpy docs -> nice formatting)

### Online HTML docs using Sphinx

![:scale 100%](img/sphinx-logo.png)

* *"tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation"*

* Originally created for the Python documentation, now used by many projects

* Uses the reStructuredText markup language

.right[http://www.sphinx-doc.org/]

???

Show a quickstart

Show the biointense docs

---

# reStructuredText


* Good intro: sphinx's [reStructuredText Primer](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html)

```rst
The plain text markup let's you write in **bold** or *italic*,
mark ``code``,

* use
* lists

Define titles
-------------

Make code blocks:

    a = 1
```

* Similar to markdown, but more powerful for complex documentation (cross references to other sections, to function definitions, extensions, ...)


---

# Some other links:

* Read the Docs (https://readthedocs.org/): documentation hosting

* Doctr (https://drdoctr.github.io/doctr/): a tool for automatically deploying docs from Travis CI to GitHub pages.

* MkDocs (http://www.mkdocs.org/): project documentation with Markdown.

* Sphinx-Gallery (http://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/): Sphinx extension for automatic generation of an example gallery
